## Introduction

This is a web-based implementation of the classic game of Checkers. The game is played on an 8x8 grid with two players, and the goal is to eliminate all of your opponent's pieces or block them from making any more moves.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward.
- If a player's piece reaches the last row on the opponent's side, it gets "kinged" and gains the ability to move diagonally in any direction.
- Players can capture their opponent's pieces by jumping over them diagonally. Multiple captures in a single turn are possible.
- The game ends when one player captures all of their opponent's pieces or blocks them from making any legal moves.

## Features

- Classic Checkers gameplay.
- Interactive board with draggable pieces.
- Valid move highlighting and piece capture animations.
- Winning modal displaying the winner.
